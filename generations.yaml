    description: "The Citroën C-Zero was a compact all-electric city car that was essentially a rebadged version of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, produced through a partnership between PSA Peugeot Citroën and Mitsubishi Motors (with the Peugeot iOn being the sister model). The distinctive egg-shaped four-door design prioritized interior space efficiency despite the vehicle's small footprint, measuring just 3.48 meters in length. Powered by a rear-mounted electric motor producing 66 HP and 180 Nm of torque, it drove the rear wheels through a single-speed transmission, offering urban-focused performance with 0-100 km/h acceleration in about 15.9 seconds and a top speed of 130 km/h. The 16 kWh lithium-ion battery was mounted under the floor and provided a real-world range of approximately 100-150 km (62-93 miles) on a full charge, with charging possible through standard household outlets (taking about 6-8 hours) or CHAdeMO quick-charging stations (80% charge in about 30 minutes). The interior was basic but functional, offering seating for four adults and standard features including power windows, air conditioning, and a basic audio system. Later models received minor updates to the battery management system and equipment levels, but the fundamental design remained unchanged throughout its production run. Despite its limited range by modern standards, the C-Zero represented an important early entry in the European electric vehicle market, particularly suited to urban environments with its compact dimensions, zero emissions, and ease of parking. Production ended around 2020 as PSA (now part of Stellantis) shifted focus to developing its own electric vehicle platforms."
